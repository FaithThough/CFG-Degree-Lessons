This repository will contain my work for the [CFGdegree](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/cfgdegree/).

## About me
Hi :wave:, I'm Faith. I'm a tech career switcher undertaking the CFGdegree to prepare me for my graudate technology role in September. 

## About the CFGdegree
The CFGdegree is an intense coding and data analysis course with a strong focus on solving real-world problems through problem-based learning. The 16-week course delivers core programming principles and practical industry-relevant teaching in order to get students job-ready and jump into a technical role.

Course modules cover a number of important areas such as the principles of architecture and lifecycle development, systems troubleshooting, agile methodology and many more to expose students to real-life problems and teach students how to approach such tasks.

### [.gitignore](.gitignore)
Git ignore allows you to specify which files or parts of your project should be ignored by git. Examples of these files may include:
